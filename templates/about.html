        This is a demonstration of our
        <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2628156">work</a>
        <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3967">in progress</a> on contract verification
        that generates counterexamples for higher-order functional programs
        using symbolic execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tool verifies a module's correctness with respect to contracts,
        which includes explicit declarations as well as implicit ones
        for primitive operations.
        Verified modules are guaranteed to be safe under all contexts.
        In addition, for each error that the module may actually cause,
        the tool generates a concrete input that triggers it.
      </p>
      <p> 
        To try the tool, enter a program to the left and press <code>Verify</code>
        to run the verification, or <code>Run</code> to run it as a regular Racket program.
        Select an example program from the top-left menu to load it.
        We currently support a small functional subset of Racket:
