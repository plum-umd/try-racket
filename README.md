try-scv-racket
==============

Soft Contract Verification (SCF) Racket	is an experimental variant of
the Racket programming language	that enables static verification of
contracts.  The	`try-scv-racket` repository implements a web-based REPL
and tutorial for SCV Racket.

To try the web REPL, visit http://scv.umiacs.umd.edu

To locally run SCV Racket, visit the [`soft-contract` repository](https://github.com/philnguyen/soft-contract).

The SCV Racket web REPL is based on [`try-racket`](https://github.com/jarcane/try-racket), a web
REPL for (plain) Racket.
