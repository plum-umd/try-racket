try-racket
==========

A web-based Racket REPL and tutorial.

Try Racket is written in Racket and JavaScript with Chris Done's [jquery-console](https://github.com/chrisdone/jquery-console).
   
   It borrows a lot of code and content from [Try Clojure](http://www.tryclj.com/) and [paste.rkt](https://github.com/samth/paste.rkt).

Slight additional modifications have since been made to remove dependencies on X11 by John Berry, with help from many others in the Racket community. Please note that the REPL and its server are still to some extent a work in progress, and community contribution is vigorously encouraged. Pull requests will likely be met with cheer, though we ask that you try to give it a little bit of testing before submitting (and we will do same as well before pushing to the live server).

## How to run it locally
    
    $ racket main.rkt
    
	Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## Temporary hack to run SCPCF locally:

* You need to modify your own version of Racket in the file
  `/Racket/share/pkgs/gui-lib/mred/private/wx/gtk/platform.rkt`,
  where the `provide` line is changed from
  `(provide (protect-out platform-values))`
  to just `(provide platform-values)`

### TODO

* Fix current hacks to get SCPCF working:

  - Path permissions in `/var/tmp`, `/tmp`, and `/bin/sh` to have `Z3` running.
	While the language SCPCF is pure and I don't see much risk,
	I'm sure there is a proper way to do this.
  - The error `name platform-values is protected`

* Aliases for characters like `•` and `λ`


## Online host
